\arguments{
\item{demo_data}{A demo data.table.}

\item{drug_data}{A drug data.table.}

\item{adr_data}{An adr data.table.}

\item{link_data}{A link data.table.}

\item{d_code}{A named list. The drug code(s) to be used. There must be
only one item in d_code.}

\item{a_code}{A named list. The adr code(s) to be used. There must be
only one item in a_code.}

\item{case_tto}{A numeric. The time to onset of the studied case. See details.}

\item{vigibase_version}{A character. The version of VigiBase used (e.g.
"September 2024"). This is passed to the plot legend.}

\item{analysis_setting}{A character. The setting of the analysis. See details.}

\item{d_label}{A character. The name of the drug, as passed to the plot legend.
Defaults to names(d_code).}

\item{a_label}{A character. The name of the adr, as passed to the plot legend.
Defaults to names(a_code).}

\item{export_to}{A character. The path to export the plot. If NULL, the plot
is not exported. Should end by ".eps", ".ps", ".tex" (pictex), ".pdf", ".jpeg",
".tiff", ".png", ".bmp", ".svg" or ".wmf" (windows only).}

\item{suspect_only}{Logical. If TRUE, only cases where the drug is suspected are used for IC analysis. If FALSE (default), all cases are used.}

\item{d_code_2}{Optional named list. A second drug code for dual drug analysis. If provided, a single analysis is performed on cases exposed to both drugs.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 graph, with two panels.
The first panel, on top, is the Information Component (IC) plot.
The arrow and "IC025 label" indicate the IC value for the selected drug-adr pair.
The second panel, on the bottom, is the Time to Onset (TTO) density plot.
It is derived only of cases where the drug was \strong{suspected} to be responsible
of the adr (irrespective of the \code{suspect_only} argument).
If you provide a case_tto value, it is represented by the red line, and the
label.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}} \code{vigi_routine()} draws
an Information Component plot and
a Time to Onset plot for a given drug-adr pair.
}
\details{
See \code{vignette("routine_pharmacovigilance")} for examples.
The output can be exported. Time to onset data are bounded between
1 day and 10 years. Data outside this range are reassigned a 1 day and 10
years value, respectively.
The function only works if there is one item in \code{d_code} and \code{a_code}.
If you are working on a specific case, you can provide a \code{case_tto} value.
This value will be displayed on the Time to Onset plot.
If your demo table was filtered on specific cases (e.g. older adults,
a subset of all drugs), then you may want to indicate this setting on the
plot legend, with arg \code{analysis_setting}.
