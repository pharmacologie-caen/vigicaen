The goal of vigicaen is to provide tools to analyze VigiBase Extract Case Level.

VigiBase is the World Health Organization's (WHO) global pharmacovigilance database 
of individual case safety reports. It is maintained by the Uppsala
Monitoring Centre in Sweden.

> This package is **NOT** supported nor reflects the opinion of the WHO, or the
Uppsala Monitoring Centre.

## Prerequisites

Users are assumed to be familiar with pharmacovigilance analysis principles.
Some useful resources can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.02.022)
(English) or [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2019.01.006) (French).

vigicaen is an R package, so you need to have R installed on your computer, and
optionally RStudio.

Use of VigiBase Extract Case Level and the subsequent WHODrug data requires 
a license from the [Uppsala Monitoring Centre](https://who-umc.org/).

Use of MedDRA requires a license from [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org/).

Of note, academic researchers are provided with accommodations for these licenses.

### Technical requisites

Vigibase ECL tables are very large, your computer must meet the
following requirements:

-   Free disk space of at least 50GB

-   At least 16GB of RAM

-   A not too old processor (partial tests conducted on 2019 Intel 7, and more recent 2023 AMD Ryzen 3)

## Target users

There are 2 types of users this package is aimed at:

-   [![PV - Routine](https://img.shields.io/badge/PV-Routine-0f7ba2)](https://pharmacologie-caen.github.io/vigicaen/articles/routine_pharmacovigilance.html) 
Routine pharmacovigilance practitioners. These users may not be 
very familiar with R, or statistics in general. They would like to 
collect additional data, when writing pharmacovigilance reports, or working
on a reported case (**information component, reaction time to onset**).
These users will be interested in the "Routine pharmacovigilance"
vignette, `vignette("routine_pharmacovigilance")`.

-    [![PV - Advanced](https://img.shields.io/badge/PV-Advanced-43b284)](https://pharmacologie-caen.github.io/vigicaen/articles/basic_workflow.html)
Advanced pharmacovigilance researchers. These users must be familiar
with R and (a bit of) statistics. The will find tools to load tables,
perform usual data management, identify drug and reaction IDs,
describe complexe features (**dechallenge, rechallenge**), perform disproportionality, and get ready-to-use
datasets to apply any regression or machine learning algorithm.

## Installation

### Solution 1

You can install the development version of vigicaen from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

> `devtools::install_github("pharmacologie-caen/vigicaen")`

### Solution 2

Find the latest Released version
[here](https://github.com/pharmacologie-caen/vigicaen/releases/latest)

Download source code as a tar.gz file.

If you use RStudio, click on "Tools", "Install Packages...", select 
"Package Archive file" and locate the tar.gz file on your computer.

Alternatively, you can use the following command in R:

`install.packages("path/to/vigicaen_X.XX.X.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")`

## Example [![PV - Routine](https://img.shields.io/badge/PV-Routine-0f7ba2)](https://pharmacologie-caen.github.io/vigicaen/articles/routine_pharmacovigilance.html)

You are working on a colitis case reported 150 days after nivolumab
initiation.

You would like to know the information component (possibly restricted
to a specific population, e.g. older adults), and the time to onset
reported for this reaction.

```{r pv_routine, eval = FALSE}
library(vigicaen)

# Step 1: Load datasets (or use example sets
# as shown below)

demo   <- demo_
adr    <- adr_
drug   <- drug_
link   <- link_
mp     <- mp_
meddra <- meddra_

# Step 2: Pick a drug and a reaction

d_code <- 
  list(
    nivolumab = "nivolumab"
  ) |> 
  get_drecno(mp = mp)

a_code <-
  list(
    colitis = "Colitis (excl infective)"
  ) |> 
  get_llt_soc(term_level = "hlt", meddra = meddra)

# Step 3: Plot results

vigi_routine(
  case_tto  = 150, # your case
  demo_data = demo,
  drug_data = drug,
  adr_data  = adr,
  link_data = link,
  d_code    = d_code,
  a_code    = a_code,
  vigibase_version = "September 2024"
)
```

```{r render_graph, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(vigicaen)

d_code <- 
  list(
    nivolumab = "nivolumab"
  ) |> 
  get_drecno(mp = mp_)

a_code <-
  list(
    colitis = "Colitis (excl infective)"
  ) |> 
  get_llt_soc(term_level = "hlt", meddra = meddra_)

g1 <- 
vigi_routine(
  case_tto  = 150, # your case
  demo_data = demo_,
  drug_data = drug_,
  adr_data  = adr_,
  link_data = link_,
  d_code    = d_code,
  a_code    = a_code,
  vigibase_version = "September 2024"
)

td <- tempdir()

ggplot2::ggsave(here::here("man", "figures", "vg.svg"), plot = g1, height = 6.7, width = 4)
```

```{r include_graph, echo = FALSE, fig.height=6.7, fig.width=4}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Example of vigi_routine with case data.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("man", "figures", "vg.svg"))
```

## Example [![PV - Advanced](https://img.shields.io/badge/PV-Advanced-43b284)](https://pharmacologie-caen.github.io/vigicaen/articles/basic_workflow.html)

You want to perform a disproportionality analysis between nivolumab exposure 
and colitis reporting (reporting odds-ratio `or` and information
component `ic`).

```{r pv_advanced, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(vigicaen)

demo <-
  demo_ |> 
  add_drug(
    d_code = ex_$d_drecno,
    drug_data = drug_
  ) |> 
  add_adr(
    a_code = ex_$a_llt,
    adr_data = adr_
  )

demo |> 
  compute_dispro(
    y = "a_colitis",
    x = "nivolumab"
  )
```

<!-- Footnote for myself

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
